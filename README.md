# MachineLearning
A repository containing machine learning algorithms in C++. This project aims to implement everything from basic linear algebra up to neuronal networks and other ML algorithms. 

At the moment, the linear algebra library is under development. While not everything is tested perfectly, there exist at least some test for each function or operator.
